This here is my cozy corner, filled with daily stories, exclusive photos & videos, and a whole lot of cuteness to brighten your day. Come for the fluff, stay for the feels. &#129505; üêæ</div>

                <p>I may come from the streets. But look at me! I am truly the offspring of Mufasa himself. No other tomcat combines cuteness and royalty like I do. Simba would be truly jealous if he knew me.</p>

                <p>I am Garfi and I love to play it real. Feathers, boxes, nail clippers, pencils - nothing is safe from me. When my human is not watching, I even play the piano. Still have to teach him that sharing is caring.</p>

                <p>I am not only adorable, when I am awake. But also, when I am asleep! As it is very hot where I live, I prefer to sleep on the cold floor or to take a nap on the window sill. Beds are overrated anyway.</p>

                <p>Look at me and tell me, you don't want to give me some cuddles! But to be honest: I prefer TO GIVE cuddles to my humans. Especially, when they are sleeping. So cute, I have to bite their knobbly noses.</p>
