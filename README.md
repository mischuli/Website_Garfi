# Garfi’s Website 🐾 | A Personal Project for The Odin Project Foundations Course

Welcome to the majestic online presence of **Garfi**, the orange tabby cat with charm, fluff, and just a hint of royal arrogance.

This site was built as part of the **Foundations Course** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), specifically the HTML, CSS & Flexbox section — but Garfi insisted on doing things *his* way. And who are we to argue with a cat?

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to apply basic HTML and CSS knowledge to create a personal landing page. Instead of following the example 1:1, I decided to create something custom and fun — a lighthearted website for Garfi, whose mission is to bring people a moment of relief from their daily scroll through seriousness.

The site invites visitors to become Garfi’s *furriends* and enjoy photos, videos, and exclusive feline content. (Think: wholesome, purring, slightly ridiculous — basically, Garfi’s version of OnlyFans.)

## ✨ Features & Personal Additions

- 🎨 Fully customized layout and style beyond the course brief
- 🖋️ Custom logo and header image designed in Canva
- 🔤 Integrated Google Fonts for visual identity
- 📱 Responsive design with early use of media queries
- ✍️ All written content from Garfi’s "paw-spective"
- 🧪 A few CSS redundancies and imperfections as this is a learning work-in-progress.

## 👥 Who’s this for?

This project may be helpful for:

- Fellow students in the **TOP community** looking for real-world beginner examples
- **Junior web developers** seeking layout, flexbox or responsive design inspiration
- **Potential employers** who want to see a bit of personality, curiosity, and creative thinking in action

## 🚧 What's next?

This is just the landing page — more sections are in the works.

## 📁 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- Google Fonts
- Canva (for graphic assets)

## 💬 A note on code & content

Feel free to inspect and learn from the **HTML & CSS code** — rebuild the layout, experiment, remix for your own practice.

> 🔒 **Please do not use any of the written content, images, or Garfi’s glorious likeness.** All content is original and under copyright. Garfi has lawyers (they’re very small and fluffy, but persistent).

## 🤝 Let’s connect

If you're on a similar coding journey, feel free to connect or share feedback. Garfi and I are always happy to hear from fellow learners and devs!
